## **Last Note**
Probably we will never come back to these, but I hope it will benefit you. If you find any hardship on the solutions feel free to leave an issue on this.

I realize that ChatGPT gets more popular to use as time passes. But as COM1002 or COM1001 tries to integrate computational logic into learning C and Python, it is important to pay attention to no only memorizing the syntax but the reason behind it.

Do not learn syntax, learn the logic.

And one last thing, do not ever lose hope. Keep fighting.

Good luck on your exams and labs.
